Lagrangian-Calculator
=====================

The project included is a simple exercise in inheritance from my Fall 2007 semester in C++ at Maryville University. While this is a relatively simplistic example for proof of concept only, it exemplifies not only the inheritance aspect, but also user interaction, switch statements, and error handling.
